# MAXMIX



Source: https://vasp.at/wiki/MAXMIX



MAXMIX = [integer]
 Default: MAXMIX = -45

Description: MAXMIX specifies the maximum number of steps stored in the Broyden mixer (IMIX=4).

MAXMIX specifies the maximum number of vectors stored in the Broyden/Pulay mixer, in other words, it corresponds to the maximal rank of the approximation of the charge-dielectric function build up by the mixer. MAXMIX can be either negative or positive:

- MAXMIX<0

- MAXMIX>0

- Caution: do not set MAXMIX>0 in the following cases. (i) If your initial positions in the POSCAR file are far from the fully relaxed positions, the ions might move considerably during relaxation. In this case, it is not expedient to "reuse" charge mixing information from the previous ionic steps. (ii) During machine learning, the first-principles calculations are often bypassed for hundreds or even thousands of ionic steps, and the ions might move considerably between first-principles calculations. In these cases using MAXMIX will very often lead to electronic divergence or strange errors during the self-consistency cycle. In general, whenever the column RMS(c) in the OSZICAR files shows a sudden increase in the norm of the charge density residual vector, try to remove the tag MAXMIX from the INCAR file.

| Mind: MAXMIX is only available in VASP.4.4 and newer versions, and it is strongly recommended to use this option for molecular dynamics and relaxations. |
